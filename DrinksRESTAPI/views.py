# Notes About Reponses

# By default, JsonResponse expects a dictionary (dict) as its first argument. Thatâ€™s because:
  # JSON objects map to Python dicts.
  # Lists could be returned by mistake and cause unexpected issues.
  # Django enforces this unless you explicitly override it.

# *******
# Making the Response list of objects into a dict with a key
# and the data being the value of that key (data is a list of objects still)
# (Basically making the return data into an object)
  # return the serializer.data in a static typed data brackets
  # The key being what you want the name of the object to be
  # The value being the serializer.data


# Rest Framework Responses
  # This type of JSON response handles all basic python containers and does not
  # require the safe parameter to be set to false

  # It is tightly coupled to the framework stack of redering views however
  # IT required the use of classed based views
